\#Edchat, short for “education chat,” was one of the first education-related X/Twitter hashtags, serving as an affinity space for teachers. In this paper, we retrospectively explored #Edchat by analyzing nearly 15 years and 17 million tweets in terms of changes in volume and content. We focus our discussion on the ever-changing nature of social media platforms and renew a call for more longitudinal research in the future.
